## Usage

### Hooks API

`@play-when-visible/react-spring` provides a set of hooks prefixed with `usePWV` to create animations. The hooks return a tuple `[ref, animation]` that contains the ref the animation. For example...

```js
import React from "react";
import { animated } from "react-spring";
import { usePWVSpring } from "@play-when-visible/react-spring";

const Page = () => {
    const [ref, animation] = usePWVSpring({
        animation: {
            from: {
                opacity: 0,
            },
            to: {
                opacity: 1,
            },
            config: {
                tension: 50,
                velocity: 12,
            },
        },
    });

    return (
        <animated.div ref={ref} style={animation}>
            Hello World!
        </animated.div>
    );
};
```

### Render Props API

`@play-when-visible/react-spring` provides a set of components prefixed with `PWV` to create animations. They work by taking in a child function that passes an object in containing the animation. For example...

```js
import React from "react";
import { animated } from "react-spring";
import { PWVSpring } from "@play-when-visible/react-spring";

const Page = () => {
    return (
        <PWVSpring
            animation={{
                from: {
                    opacity: 0,
                },
                to: {
                    opacity: 1,
                },
                config: {
                    tension: 50,
                    velocity: 12,
                },
            }}
        >
            {({ animation }) => (
                <animated.div style={animation}>Hello World!</animated.div>
            )}
        </PWVSpring>
    );
};
```
